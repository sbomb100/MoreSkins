You will include real content for your four pages (no Lorem ipsum). 
If your wireframes called for a paragraph of text, write a real paragraph of text. 
You can use images downloaded from other sites for this project, but you must credit the source of each using HTML or CSS comments.

To gain experience translating a wireframe into a mockup, you will produce one HTML page for each wireframe from Project 1, 
for a total of at least 5 HTML pages.

Your HTML pages should use semantic, standards-compliant markup, using either the XHTML 1.1 or HTML5 doctypes. 
As discussed in class, semantic markup means you are using HTML markup that matches your content: 
paragraphs are enclosed in <p> tags; 
main headings use <h1> tags, etc. 
Standards-compliant means the HTML validates.

The following elements should be included:

    At least five different HTML elements
    At least two images
    At least one form, two different form inputs (e.g. textbox, textarea, checkboxes) and one button
    A primary navigation menu

Since this is an interactive prototype, your HTML pages should be hyperlinked to each other, so be sure your prototype contains a reasonable navigation system to allow this.
